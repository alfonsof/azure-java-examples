Errors caused by signed jars in dependencies.

We have to remove from the jar file the files:

  META-INF/BCKEY.DSA
  META-INF/BCKEY.SF
  META-INF/MSFTSIG.RSA
  META-INF/MSFTSIG.SF

In order to avoid error messages like:
  
  "Invalid signature file digest for Manifest main attributes"
  "Error: Could not find or load main class Main example.AzureVM"

We can exclude these files with "maven-shade-plugin" in "pom.xml" file.

Working with IntelliJ this functionality does not work.

So, we remove the files with one of these commands after the jar file is created:

- MacOS / Linux:
  $ zip -d out/artifacts/azureblobstoragecreate_jar/azureblobstoragecreate.jar "META-INF/*.RSA" "META-INF/*.DSA" "META-INF/*.SF"

- 7-zip tool:
  $ 7z d -tzip out/artifacts/azureblobstoragecreate_jar/azureblobstoragecreate.jar META-INF/*.RSA META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.SF
